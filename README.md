# NetMHCphosPan-1.0

The NetMHCphosPan-1.0 server predicts binding of phosphorylated peptides to any MHC molecule of known sequence using artificial neural networks (ANNs).

This repo contains the data files used to train and evaluate NetMHCphosPan-1.0.

File description:
- **f00{n}.EL.sty**: training partitions;

- **c00{n}.EL.sty**: test partitions for training;

- **allelelist.final**: a list of the cell lines and their assigned HLA-alleles used for training;

- **allelelist.bench**: a list of the cell lines and their assigned HLA-alleles used for evaluation (benchmark);
